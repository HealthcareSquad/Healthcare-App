# Healthcare-App
This is our project DocFinder for the Brandeis University 2017 JBS program. 

<strong>What is our app?</strong>

DocFinder is a voice-enabled search application that provides a list of doctors specified by your search queries. Search can be done by your insurance provider, the type of doctor you are looking for, the location you like to search from, and languages. The list of doctors is returned in order of distance from your specified location. 

<strong>How to use our app?</strong>

Run our app using 'meteor run' in the terminal. The DocFinder app will be loaded onto localhost:3000. 
In the home page of the app, click the blue microphone button to speak to the app. You can immediately ask for the kind of doctor you are looking for using an utterance such as "I am looking for a general practitioner" or make a greeting to the app to initiate conversation. 
The microphone button will turn red when listening to your speech and automatically return to blue when you are finished. The app will then direct you to a list of doctors that fit your query. The names of the doctors produce profiles that the user can look at for information such as, a location, biography, phone number, and payments from pharmaceutical companies. 

Other pages of the app are located via the hamburger menu and include an about page, contact page, and user sign-in.
