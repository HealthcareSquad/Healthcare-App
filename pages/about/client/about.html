  <p>Our app provides our users information on doctors that are located near their geographic area.<br>
    Such information may include, speciality, insurance company they take, languages they speak, and<br>
    reviews. Users can ask these specifics to filter through the selection of doctors they would like<br>
    to choose. Finally, users can ask to schedule an appointment and the app would direct them to a phone number. </p>
