  <h1>What are the DocFinder commands?</h1>
  There are multiple ways to find a nearby doctor using DocFinder.
  <ul>
    <li>Search by your location and insurance company, to be provided a list of doctor's within a 5 mile radius of your location</li>
    <li>Location can be given simply as a city and state or as the exact street address. More precise location information will provide more exact results.</li>
    <li>Additionally, you can search according to a doctor's spoken language. Simply, say "I need a doctor who knows Spanish."</li>
    <li>DocFinder is conversational! Feel free to say "What's up" or any other greeting and DocFinder will respond.</li>

  </ul>
